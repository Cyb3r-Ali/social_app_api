# Today's Update (18-3-2024): Setting Up Database Connection and Server

## Overview
Today, we accomplished the following milestones in our project:

- Successfully set up the database connection using `mysql2` and environment variables from a `.env` file with `dotenv`.
- Configured an Express server in `index.js` with middleware for body parsing and serving static files.
- Pushed our project code to GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## Achievements
- **Database Connection:** Created `db.js` for database configuration, ensuring efficient database interactions.
- **Server Configuration:** Configured middleware and static file serving in Express for a robust server setup.
- **GitHub Push:** Ensured version control and collaboration by pushing our project to GitHub.

## Next Steps
Moving forward, our focus will be on:
- Implementing CRUD operations for database interactions.
- Adding authentication and authorization to secure our application.
- Enhancing user experience with additional features and functionalities.

## Challenges Faced
We encountered minor issues with Git's line endings during the setup, but we successfully resolved them by configuring Git appropriately.

Today's progress marks a significant step forward, and we look forward to further development and improvements in our application.
